## 2.Project Title

"Evaluating the Association of Cigarette Smoking and Physical Activity with Multiple Metabolic(BMI and Blood pressure) and Lipid Biomarkers (Glycohemoglobin, Fasting Glucose, HDL-Cholesterol, Total Cholesterol, and Triglycerides) Among Adults(Males and Females, Aged 18 and Older) in NHANES"

## 3. Main Statistical Question

"How do cigarette smoking status and physical activity levels jointly associate with key metabolic(BMI and Blood pressure) and lipid biomarkers (Glycohemoglobin, Fasting Glucose, Direct HDL-Cholesterol, Total Cholesterol, and Triglycerides) in adults aged 18 and older?"

## 4. Unit of Observation and Interpretable Population

**Unit of Observation:**

One individual NHANES participant.

Each row in the final analytical dataset represents one participant.

**Target Population:**

Adults aged 20 years and older living in the United States during the NHANES 2021–2023 survey period.

**Sampling Method:**

NHANES uses a multistage, stratified, clustered probability sampling design to obtain a representative sample of the noninstitutionalized U.S. population.

Data are collected through household interviews, physical examinations at Mobile Examination Centers (MEC), and laboratory measurements.

The complex sampling design and appropriate survey weights will be considered during the analysis.

## 5. Main Variables and Measurement Scales

The variables are initially divided into four groups.

### A. Physical Activity Variables

| Variable | Description | Measurement Scale |
|---|---|---|
| PAD790Q | Frequency of moderate-intensity leisure-time physical activity | Discrete quantitative |
| PAD790U | Unit of frequency | Categorical |
| Other relevant PAQ variables | Frequency and duration of physical activities | Quantitative / Categorical |

### B. Smoking Variables

| Variable | Description | Measurement Scale |
|---|---|---|
| SMQ020 | Whether the participant has smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime | Binary categorical |
| SMQ040 | Current smoking frequency among eligible participants | Categorical |
| Other relevant SMQ variables | Additional smoking-related information | Categorical / Quantitative |

### C. General Health Indicators

| Variable | Description | Measurement Scale |
|---|---|---|
| BMXBMI | Body Mass Index (kg/m²) | Continuous quantitative |
| BPXOSY1, BPXOSY2, etc. | Systolic blood pressure readings | Continuous quantitative |
| BPXODI1, BPXODI2, etc. | Diastolic blood pressure readings | Continuous quantitative |
| LBDHDD | HDL cholesterol (mg/dL) | Continuous quantitative |

### D. Demographic Variables

| Variable | Description | Measurement Scale |
|---|---|---|
| RIDAGEYR | Age in years | Quantitative |
| RIAGENDR | Gender | Categorical |

The final variable list will be refined after examining the NHANES documentation and the actual data files.

## 6. Roles of Variables in the Research Question

| Role | Variables |
|---|---|
| Main explanatory variables | Physical activity and smoking status |
| Primary response variable | BMI |
| Additional response variables | Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and HDL cholesterol |
| Control variables | Age and gender |

The roles of variables may change depending on the specific statistical question.

For example, BMI can be the response variable when examining its association with physical activity and smoking. Other health indicators can also be investigated separately.

## 7. Type of Statistical Question

**Primary Question Type: Associational**

The project primarily investigates associations between physical activity, smoking behavior, and general health indicators.

Descriptive and comparative analyses will also be performed.

The project does not aim to establish causal relationships.

## 8. Initial Hypothesis

**Initial Scientific Hypothesis:**

Physical activity and smoking behavior may be associated with general health indicators.

Higher levels of physical activity may be associated with more favorable health indicators, while smoking may be associated with less favorable health indicators.

Furthermore, the combination of physical activity and smoking behavior may reveal different patterns of association with general health.

**Example Statistical Hypotheses:**

For the association between physical activity and BMI:

- H₀: There is no statistical association between physical activity and BMI.
- H₁: There is a statistical association between physical activity and BMI.

For the association between smoking status and HDL cholesterol:

- H₀: There is no statistical difference in HDL cholesterol levels across smoking-status groups.
- H₁: There is a statistical difference in HDL cholesterol levels across smoking-status groups.

The exact hypotheses and statistical tests will be determined after finalizing the variables and their measurement scales.

## 9. Initial Limitations

The following limitations are anticipated:

1. **Cross-sectional data:** NHANES 2021–2023 does not establish temporal or causal relationships between physical activity, smoking, and health indicators.

2. **Self-reported measurements:** Physical activity and smoking information are primarily collected through questionnaires and may be affected by reporting errors.

3. **Missing data:** Some participants may have incomplete questionnaire responses or missing examination and laboratory measurements.

4. **Complex sampling design:** NHANES uses a complex sampling design, requiring appropriate consideration of survey weights, strata, and clusters.

5. **Subgroup sample size:** Dividing participants into multiple physical activity and smoking categories may reduce the sample size in some groups.

6. **Limited health indicators:** BMI, blood pressure, and HDL cholesterol represent only selected aspects of general health and cannot provide a complete assessment of an individual's health.

7. **Potential confounding variables:** Other factors, such as age, gender, diet, and socioeconomic conditions, may influence the observed associations.
